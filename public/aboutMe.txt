i’m tony toskalio, born and raised in austria with five brothers and one sister. our roots go back to romania. growing up, i loved tv, drawing, and digging through old books at thrift stores. those early habits sparked my passion for visual media. over the years, i’ve worked on projects with amazing people, creating beautiful things together. for my diploma thesis, i created the syπthesizer. project where i designed both the physical form and the user interface of a modern synth. one of my proudest works is the mundane., a short film shown at htl donaustadt’s open house. i stay curious across disciplines including graphic and logo design, typography, photography, coding (especially vibe coding), and visual installations like music visualizers and camera shaders. my biggest inspiration has always been my father. next, i’m diving deeper into video work.
